Frog moves in all directions.
There are 6 moving cars and 5 logs.
There are cars moving left to right and right to left.
Cars kill frog.
Log allows frog on it and moves the frog.
Going off the edges of the screen kills frog.
Cars and logs respawn if they go off screen by popping up on the opposite side.
Going into water or swamp kills frog.
There are 3 displayed lives, if frog dies 3 times the game will close after 1 second.
Frog respawns at roughly the center of the bottom row if killed.
